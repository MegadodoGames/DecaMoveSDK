# DecaMoveSDK

The DecaMove SDK allows for native support for the DecaMove to be intigrated into projects directally. This allows for creators to take advantage of the rotation, button, and haptics of the DecaMove device. This branch contains example projects that need more validation.

## Documentation

## Limitations
There is currently only a Unity and Native SDK, but the Native SDK should work for Unreal.

The SDK only supports the DecaMove device itself and not emultated devices such as phones or SteamVR trackers, though support for this is coming soon.

## Support
